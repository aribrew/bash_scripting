# [Eternal WIP] A bunch of BASH scripts

This repo contains a lot of BASH scripts created for my use.

The bash_helpers.sh one is a special one, because it contains functions
intended for being sourced to do many things you usually need while scripting,
like obtain the extension of a file, check if a IP exists, or asking for info.

There are others, like the isomount one, that aren't used so widely, and
because that, they aren't integrated in the helpers script.
